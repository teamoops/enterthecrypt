# crypto tools

* ascii2hex - converts ascii hex values (i.e. ffffff) to the literal byte values (should be used in a pipeline)
* onlyascii - shows only valid ascii characters (minus control characters) in case you're reading a bunch of binary and don't want to screw up your terminal
* xor       - an xor tool that can repeatedly xor the second file against the first with the -r flag

# other crypt tools that are probably already installed on your system

* base64
* sha256
* xxd (likely to use xxd -p)
* hexdump
